# LogLevels
This is a project in which there's three functions:

1- message: input the log ==> output log message without the type of the log;

2- LogLevel: input the log ==> see the type of the log ( INFO, WARNING or ERROR );

3- reformat: input the log ==> make a new string where message is first and type of log after;

Logs used:
* [INFO]: Operation complete 
* [WARNING]: Disk is almost full 
* [ERROR]: Invalid operation
